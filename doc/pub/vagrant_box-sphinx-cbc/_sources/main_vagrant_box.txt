Creating Vagrant Machines for Distribution of Software Environments
===================================================================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen, Anders E. Johansen
:Date: Jun 11, 2014

Scientific software soon gets very complicated to install because
packages build on numerous other packages, some of which may be hard
to compile and link successfully on a system. Those who frequently
need to make sure their target audience (consisting typically of
students, collaborators, or customers) has a certain set of packages
installed on their system, run into a serious problem when
few in the target audience have the competence, interest, and
patience to install all the packages on their computer with its
particular version of the operating system.

There are many working solutions to this problem:

 * Long technical installation descriptions that in practice
   require considerable experience with compiling and linking
   software packages.

 * Ready-made, easy-to-install files for particular platforms,
   e.g., Debian packages (``.deb`` files) for Linux systems like Ubuntu,
   ``.dmg`` bundles for Mac, or ``.exe`` files for Windows.
   It can still be quite some work for a user to install the
   right combination of many packages, although each package
   gets installed by a double click.

 * Virtual machines, such as VirtualBox, Parallels, and VMWare Fusion,
   can run a particular operating system and thereby take advantage
   of the most easy-to-use platform from an installation perspective.
   In particular, one can run Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux systems
   and use the ``apt-get install`` and ``pip install`` commands
   to make installation of packages and their dependencies trivial.

A `Vagrant machine <http://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ is essentially a
wrapper around VirtualBox which makes it very easy to build, distribute, and
use a virtual machine.
The present document describes how to create and operate a Vagrant machine.
The target audience of the document is scientists who wants to
spend a minimum of efforts on offering
or using a complete computing environment with much
sophisticated, hard-to-install mathematical software.

.. index:: host

.. index:: Vagrant machine

By *host* we mean the operating system
used to build or run a Vagrant machine. Operating system commands
issued on the host have a prompt ``Terminal>`` while commands issued
in the Vagrant machine feature the prompt ``Machine>``.

.. !split

Problem setting
===============

We shall work with a specific example: creating a computing
environment for the participants in a course on computational X,
where X is any science or engineering subject such as chemistry,
physics, quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, oceanography, and so forth.
The challenge with courses featuring heavy computations
is two-fold:

1. to minimize the amount of time the audience spends on
   installation issues and

2. to minimize the teacher's hassle with all
   types of operating systems that might be present on the laptops
   in the audience.

An attractive solution to this minimization problem is to create a
Vagrant machine, which is simply a file with a virtual ready-made
computer that anyone in the audience can easily download and use on
any Windows or Mac computer.

Another advantage is that all users of a Vagrant machine have exactly
the same computing environment (unless they modify the machine).  The
teacher can then easily debug a user problem inside the teacher's own
Vagrant machine. And anything that the teacher demonstrates on her
computer works out of the box on the participants' computers.

Different types of Vagrant machines can be made for different types of
courses or purposes.  For example, a research project can set up a
software environment for its project members, as a Vagrant machine, to
ensure that the environment is conserved for the future, which is a
key principle for reproducible science. Users may have many Vagrant
machines on their computers and switch between the computing
environments.

Contents of the Vagrant machine
-------------------------------

The Vagrant machine needs to have an operating system. Here we choose
Ubuntu of two main reasons:

1. software on Ubuntu can be trivially installed as
   Debian packages

2. the Debian software repository is at the time of this writing the richest
   repository for pre-built mathematical software.

We remark that the user of the machine will mainly work with files
and directories on the host system and only use the Ubuntu system
to run computations.

To be specific, the sample computing environment to be illustrated here
consists of a Python-based ecosystem for scientific computing.
Examples on basic software includes

 * Text editors: ``emacs``, ``vim``, ``gedit``

 * Compilers: ``gcc``, ``g++``, ``gfortran``

 * Numerical libraries: ATLAS

 * Python packages: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``sympy``, ``matplotlib``,
   ``ScientificPython``

Most of these packages are in Debian and trivially installed by a
``sudo apt-get install packagename`` command, but the Python packages
are often more conveniently installed in their latest version by a ``pip
install packagename`` command. A few Python packages must be installed
directly from the source code, via downloading followed by
the ``sudo python setup.py install``
command, if they do not exist in Debian, or if they are not supported
by ``pip install``, or if one needs to download the latest development
version. The example will in detail illustrate the various cases.

Much more sophisticated packages than those listed above,
for instance `PETSc <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_
and `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`_, may be very challenging to
build from scratch, but as long as Debian versions are offered
(which is the case with PETSc and FEniCS), installation on a Debian-based
system like Ubuntu is still just a trivial ``apt-get install`` command.

.. index:: .bashrc file

.. index:: .rsyncexclude file

In the Vagrant machine, we create two directories:

 * ``~/bin`` for executable programs and scripts

 * ``~/srclib`` for Python packages installed from source code

We also include two useful files:

 * A small, but illustrative `~/.bashrc <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/.bashrc>`_ file for
   setting up the Linux system.

 * `~/.rsyncexclude <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/.rsyncexclude>`_ for excluding certain
   files when running ``rsync`` for copying files between machines, or
   between machines and external disks or memory sticks.

.. _vagrant:install:

Installing the necessary software for using Vagrant
---------------------------------------------------

Before going into details on how to utilize Vagrant, you need to
have it on your host system.

.. index:: VirtualBox installation

.. index::
   single: installation of; VirtualBox

VirtualBox
~~~~~~~~~~

Download and install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_. Choose the version
according to the operating system on the host.
For example, if you want to build or run Vagrant machines under Mac OS X, choose
*VirtualBox x.y.z for OS X hosts*, where ``x.y.z`` is the version number
of VirtualBox. Double click the downloaded ``.dmg`` file to install
Vagrant. Those who work on a Windows machines will select *VirtualBox
x.y.z for Windows hosts*, which downloads an ``.exe`` file which can just
be double clicked to perform the installation.

Installing VirtualBox on Ubuntu and other Linux systems
can be challenging.
Here is a recipe. Start with

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> sudo apt-cache search virtualbox

to find a package ``virtualbox-X``, where ``X`` denotes a particular
version number (e.g., ``4.2``). Then copy and paste the following
commands into the terminal window:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> wget -q \ 
         http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc \ 
         -O- | sudo apt-key add -
        Terminal> sudo sh -c 'echo \ 
         "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian precise contrib" \ 
         >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
        Terminal> sudo apt-get update
        Terminal> sudo apt-get install virtualbox-X

(Recall to replace ``X`` by the appropriate version number.)
You may need to run ``sudo apt-get -f install`` and upgrade packages.
It is easier to work with VirtualBox
on Mac or Windows if you run into trouble with Ubuntu.

We recommend to install VirtualBox as shown above on Ubuntu rather than
downloading a particular ``.deb`` file (Debian package) from
the `VirtualBox site <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_, because
the ``apt-get install`` approach above makes it easier to explicitly get all the
packages that VirtualBox depends on.

.. index:: Vagrant installation

.. index::
   single: installation of; Vagrant

Vagrant
~~~~~~~

Download and install `Vagrant <http://downloads.vagrantup.com/>`_.
Choose the latest version and the installation file corresponding to
the host's operating system (where you installed VirtualBox).  On a Mac, you
select the ``Vagrant-x.y.z.dmg`` file (``x.y.z`` denotes the version of
the software), on Windows the ``Vagrant_x.y.z.msi`` file is the
relevant choice.
On Ubuntu, select ``vagrant_x.y.z_*.deb`` and install it
by ``sudo dpkg -i vagrant_x.y.z_*.deb``.

On Windows and Mac OS X, the ``vagrant`` command is automatically
available after installation (because the directory where the
``vagrant`` executable resides is placed in your ``PATH`` environment
variable).
This is true for many Linux systems too, otherwise you must
add the relevant directory where the ``vagrant`` program was installed
(say ``/opt/vagrant/bin``) to your ``PATH`` variable.

.. index:: Cygwin installation

.. index::
   single: installation of; Cygwin

Cygwin (only on Windows)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows computers do not feature an ssh client and an X server by
default, which are needed in scientific applications. Therefore, we
recommend to install `Cygwin <http://cygwin.com/install.html>`_, which
gives easy access to an ssh-client and an X-server on Windows
computers.  Actually, Cygwin extends Windows with a complete Unix
environment.  Download the Cygwin's `setup.exe <http://cygwin.com/setup.exe>`_ file and follow the instructions given
by the installer. Only the minimal base packages from the Cygwin
distribution are installed by default. This means that we need to
manually select the 'X11' category during installation to install
Cygwin's X11 server. Notice that downloading Cygwin might take one or
more hours, depending on the speed of your network.

Once installed, we need to add Cygwin's ssh client to our
``PATH``. Cygwin is by default installed to ``C:\cygwin``, so the command
is ``set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin``.

Creating the Vagrant machine
============================

In this section we explain how to select an operating system for
the Vagrant machine, how to install pre-compiled binary packages,
how to install (Python) packages from source code, and how to configure
the machine.

Choice of operating system type
-------------------------------

.. index:: base box

.. index:: precise64.box (Ubuntu base box)

The first step of building a Vagrant machine is to choose a plain
version of an operating system to base the machine on. This is called
a *base box*. A lot of pre-made base boxes for various versions of
operating systems are available at `<http://www.vagrantbox.es>`_.
(If, for some reason, you want to build a base box with another
operating system, there are `instructions <http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/base_boxes.html>`_ for that.)  Let
us decide on adopting *Ubuntu precise 64*, which we find down on the
list.  This is a version of Ubuntu 12.04
(``precise`` refers to the official Ubuntu name Precise Pangolin for
version 12.04).  Click on *Copy* to copy the URL.
You have now two choices:

.. index:: complete Vagrant machine

.. index:: empty Vagrant machine

1. you can build and distribute a complete
   virtual machine, or

2. the user can download a box and then automatically install
   a list of prescribed packages in the box.

The former approach, called a *complete Vagrant machine* in the following,
results in one big file containing the machine. The latter approach,
referred to as a *Vagrant machine specification* results in very
small text files to be distributed to the users.

The advantage of a complete Vagrant machine is that users can download
one big file and they immediately have an operative machine. You are also
guaranteed that all users have identical environments. An empty
Vagrant machine is easy to distribute, but the disadvantage is that
a user's initialization of the machine takes (very) long time since
a lot of packages must be downloaded and installed. Something can go
wrong with the installation. It may also happen that different users
get slightly different environments because they run the installation
process of their machines at different times.

Downloading a base box to create a complete Vagrant machine
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. index:: vagrant box add

.. index:: vagrant init

.. index:: vagrant up

Paste the copied URL of the chosen box in
a new browser tab. This action should automatically
download a file ``precise64.box``.
Say you store this file in a directory ``~/vagrant``. Go to this
directory and run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant box add mybox precise64.box
        Terminal> vagrant init mybox
        Terminal> vagrant up

The result is now an initialized Vagrant machine ``mybox`` which you
can log into. The
``vagrant`` directory where these commands are run is
known as the *project directory* in the `Vagrant documentation <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/>`_.

Making an empty Vagrant machine
-------------------------------

.. index:: vagrant init

.. index:: Vagrantfile

Make some directory (say) ``~/vagrant``, move to this directory, and
type

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant init

This command creates a ``Vagrantfile``. Invoke the file in a text editor
and replace the line ``config.vm.box = "base"`` by the URL to the
base box and add another line ``config.ssh.forward_x11 = true`` to
enable X11 graphics. The ``Vagrantfile`` looks something like

.. code-block:: ruby

        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
          # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration
          # options are documented and commented below. For a complete reference,
          # please see the online documentation at vagrantup.com.
        
          # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
          config.vm.box = http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
          config.ssh.forward_x11 = true
          ...
        end

.. !split

.. _vagrant:complete:install:

Installing packages in a complete Vagrant machine
-------------------------------------------------

This section assumes that you want to build and distribute
a complete Vagrant machine as defined above.
There is not much installed yet on the ``mybox`` machine, but
this is an Ubuntu system where we
can very easily install what we want via ``sudo apt-get install``
or ``pip install`` commands, or by downloading source code and
performing manual installation. The section :ref:`vagrant:debpkg` describes a type of file for listing
packages and Unix commands, with an associated tool ``deb2sh.py``
for automatic generation of installation scripts.
Using these utilities,
it is close to trivial to create a rich computing environment.

Creating files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you are logged out of the Vagrant machine (Ctrl-D) and
located in the project directory on the host.
Download `default versions <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant>`_ of some key files:
``deb2sh.py``, ``debpkg_minimal.txt``, ``.bashrc``, and ``.rsyncexclude``.
Just click on the files, choose
the *Raw* version, and right-click to save each file to the project
directory.
Read about the former two files in
the section :ref:`vagrant:debpkg` and the latter two in
the section :ref:`vagrant:bashrc`. Edit the files to your users' needs.
Then run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python deb2sh.py debpkg_minimal.txt

to produce a Bash script ``install_minimal.sh`` and an equivalent
Python script ``install_minimal.py``.
Make sure you run all the commands in the
project directory (``~/vagrant``).

You may alternatively download the more comprehensive `debpkg.txt <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/debpkg.txt>`_
package list and use that file as a starting point. Running ``deb2sh.py debpkg.txt``
will produce the scripts ``install.sh`` and ``install.py``.

.. index:: vagrant ssh

.. index:: /vagrant (shared) directory

Installing files and packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have edited the above files according to your users' needs,
you are ready to log into the Vagrant machine, copy files to the
machine and run the installation.
The project directory is visible as ``/vagrant`` inside the Vagrant
machine (see the section :ref:`vagrant:shareddir`
for more details). The relevant login command is ``vagrant ssh``, here
followed by two copy commands:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant ssh
        Machine> cp /vagrant/.bashrc .
        Machine> cp /vagrant/.rsyncexclude .

Now you can run the (lengthy) installation process by

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> bash /vagrant/install_minimal.sh

or

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> python /vagrant/install_minimal.py

If something goes wrong with the installation, edit the script
on the host system (invoke ``/vagrant/install_minimal.sh`` in an
editor) and rerun the installation command inside the Vagrant
machine.

You may want to include the installation scripts in the box so that
users can see exactly what has been installed and rerun installation
commands if necessary (e.g., at a later stage to update the software).

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> cp /vagrant/install_minimal.sh .
        Machine> cp /vagrant/install_minimal.py .

.. index:: X11 graphics

Enabling X11 graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended that you test graphics programs and check that they
display the graphics on the host appropriately. To this end, you
need to enable X11 graphics on the host by editing the file ``Vagrantfile``
in the project directory so that it includes the
line ``config.ssh.forward_x11 = true``:

.. code-block:: ruby

        Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
            ...
            # Enable X11
            config.ssh.forward_x11 = true
            ...
        end

To get X11 graphics to work, you must also
start X11 on the host: run Applications - Utilities - X11
on a Mac, or invoke Start - All Programs - Cygwin-X - XWin Server
on Windows.

A simple application just to test X11 is to run ``xterm`` from the Vagrant
machine. A terminal window will pop up on the host.

.. index:: vagrant package

Packaging a new box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When everything is copied to the box, installed, and tested,
we need to package
the installed virtual environment into a box in order to distribute it to other
users. Log out of the machine and finalize the machine by
running the ``vagrant package`` command in the project directory:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant package --output course.box \ 
                  --vagrantfile Vagrantfile

The settings in ``Vagrantfile`` are now packed with the box. In particular,
if X11 graphics has been enabled in ``Vagrantfile`` as described above,
you have
a fully functioning Ubuntu machine in ``course.box`` that will work
seamlessly with
X11 graphics on the host. Users can just do

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant box add course course.box
        Terminal> vagrant init course
        Terminal> vagrant up
        Terminal> vagrant ssh

A real machine (containing what is listed earlier, plus the
`FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`_ software) can be downloaded
from Google Drive at `<http://goo.gl/ta977B>`_ (note the file size: 3.8Gb!).

.. !split

.. _vagrant:empty:install:

Installing packages in an empty Vagrant machine
-----------------------------------------------

An empty Vagrant machine is distributed to users
as a bundle of ``Vagrantfile`` and an
installation script.
Read the section :ref:`vagrant:debpkg`
and make a Bash installation script.

You may want to distribute
``.bashrc`` and
``.rsyncexlude`` files too, as described in
the section :ref:`vagrant:bashrc`, but that is easiest done by letting
the installation script download the files from site where they
are available.  Relevant lines may be

.. code-block:: text

        $ cd $HOME
        $ wget http://tinyurl.com/m88bljf/.bashrc
        $ wget http://tinyurl.com/m88bljf/.rsyncexclude

.. index:: Vagrantfile

To ensure that the user's initialization process of the machine
invokes an installation of the desired packages, you need to
add a line to ``Vagrantfile`` that runs the Bash script.
Say the name of the script is ``install_minimal.sh``.
The relevant line is shown below:

.. code-block:: ruby

        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
          ...
          # Run installation
          config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "install_minimal.sh"
          ...
        end

Users must now have the files ``Vagrantfile`` and ``install_minimal.sh``
to create a complete Vagrant machine on their computers.

.. !split

.. _vagrant:debpkg:

Scripts for installing ready-made packages
------------------------------------------

.. index:: deb2sh.py script

.. index:: debpkg.txt package lists

.. index:: installation scripts

.. index:: scripts for installing packages

.. index:: package installation

We have developed a little tool where one can list the desired Debian
or Python packages in a computing environment in a file with default name
``debkpg.txt``. This file may also contain plain Unix commands for
doing other types of installation, like ``pip install``, or
cloning of source code repositories with subsequent execution of
a ``setup.py`` file. Concrete examples are listed below.

A little Python script `deb2sh.py <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/deb2sh.py>`_ reads the
installation specification in some file `debpkg_minimal.txt <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/debpkg_minimal.txt>`_ and
creates a Bash script `install_minimal.sh <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/install_minimal.sh>`_ and an
equivalent Python script `install_minimal.py <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/install_minimal.py>`_ for
running all the necessary operating system commands to install
all the packages in the correct order.  The script aborts if any package
cannot be installed successfully. The problem must
then be fixed, or the package must in worst case be removed (just
comment out the install line(s) in the Bash or Python script).  The
script can thereafter be rerun again.

.. index:: sudo apt-get install

.. index:: pip install

The following is an extract of packages as they are listed
in the mentioned ``debpkg_minimal.txt`` file:

.. code-block:: text

        # Minimal installation for a Python ecosystem
        # for scientific computing
        
        # Editors
        emacs python-mode gedit vim ispell
        
        # Compilers
        gcc g++ gawk f2c gfortran
        autoconf automake autotools-dev
        
        # Numerical libraries
        libatlas-base-dev libsuitesparse-dev
        
        # Python
        idle
        python-pip
        python-dev
        # Matplotlib requires libfreetype-dev libpng-dev
        # (otherwise pip install matplotlib does not work)
        libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev
        pip install numpy
        pip install sympy
        #pip install matplotlib   # pip may fail for matplotlib
        python-matplotlib
        pip install scipy
        
        # ScientificPython must be installed from source
        $ if [ ! -d srclib ]; then mkdir srclib; fi
        $ cd srclib
        $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/khinsen/scientificpython
        $ cd scientificpython
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        $ cd ../..

The syntax has four elements:

1. comment lines are just copied to the
   Bash and Python installation scripts,

2. lines starting with ``$`` are plain Unix
   commands and run by the installation scripts,

3. lines starting with
   ``pip install`` lists packages to be installed with ``pip``, while

4. all other non-blank
   lines are supposed to list the name of Debian packages to be installed
   by ``sudo apt-get install`` commands.

The examples above show all four line types. Observe in particular how
we can freely add Unix commands to download ``ScientificPython`` from its
Bitbucket repo (done in the ``srclib`` subdirectory) and
install the package manually by running ``setup.py`` the usual way.

Some examples on lines in the automatically generated ``install_minimal.sh``
script are

.. code-block:: bash

        #!/bin/bash
        # Automatically generated script. Based on debpkg.txt.
        
        function apt_install {
          sudo apt-get -y install $1
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "could not install $1 - abort"
            exit 1
          fi
        }
        
        function pip_install {
          for p in $@; do
            sudo pip install $p
            if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
              echo "could not install $p - abort"
              exit 1
            fi
          done
        }
        
        function unix_command {
          $@
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "could not run $@ - abort"
            exit 1
          fi
        }
        
        sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
        
        # Minimal installation for a Python ecosystem
        # for scientific computing
        
        # Editors
        apt_install python-mode gedit vim ispell
        ...
        pip_install numpy
        pip_install sympy
        apt_install scipy
        ...
        # ScientificPython must be installed from source
        unix_command if [ ! -d srclib ]; then mkdir srclib; fi
        unix_command cd srclib
        unix_command hg clone https://bitbucket.org/khinsen/scientificpython
        unix_command cd scientificpython
        unix_command sudo python setup.py install


.. note::
   
    * Installation commands may fail. Therefore we have made separate
      functions for doing the ``apt-get`` and ``pip install`` commands.
      We test the value of the environment variable ``$?`` after the
      installation of a package: a successful installation implies
      value of 0, while values different from 0 mean that something
      went wrong. We then abort the script with ``exit 1``.
   
    * The ``apt-get install`` command will prompt the user for questions for
      every package, but here we use the option ``-y`` to automatically
      rely on default answers, i.e., accepting ``yes`` to all questions.




The corresponding lines in the equivalent, automatically
generated ``install.py`` file look as follows.

.. code-block:: python

        import commands, sys
        
        def system(cmd):
            """Run system command cmd."""
            failure, output = commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)
            if failure:
               print 'Command\n  %s\nfailed.' % cmd
               print output
               sys.exit(1)
        
        system('sudo apt-get update --fix-missing')
        
        system('sudo apt-get -y install python-mode gedit vim ispell')
        ...
        system('pip install numpy')
        system('pip install sympy')
        system('sudo apt-get -y install scipy')
        ...
        system('if [ ! -d srclib ]; then mkdir srclib; fi')
        system('cd srclib')
        sytem('hg clone https://bitbucket.org/khinsen/scientificpython')
        system(' cd scientificpython')
        system('sudo python setup.py install')

The Python script does not test the Unix environment variable ``$?``,
but the first return value from the ``getstatusoutput`` function acts as
the value of ``$?``.

We can use the Bash or Python script to easily automate installation
of packages in the Vagrant machine. More powerful, industry standard
tools for setting up complete software environments are `Chef <http://www.opscode.com/>`_ and `Puppet <https://puppetlabs.com/>`_.

.. _vagrant:bashrc:

Setting up a default environment with ``.bashrc``
-------------------------------------------------

.. index:: .bashrc file

.. index:: .rsyncexclude file

We should include a brief ``.bashrc`` file in the Vagrant
machine as a starting point for the
user's customization of her Unix environment. Here is an `example <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/.bashrc>`_:

.. code-block:: text

        # ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
        # see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples
        
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/pythonlib
        export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
        
        # Create some aliases for rsync commands for copying files:
        rsync_basic="-rtDvz -u -e ssh -b"
        rsync_excl="--exclude-from=$HOME/.rsyncexclude"
        rsync_del="--suffix=.rsync~ --delete --force"
        scp_rsync="rsync $rsync_basic $rsync_excl"
        scp_rsync_del="$scp_rsync $rsync_del"
        alias scp_rsync="$scp_rsync"
        alias scp_rsync_del="$scp_rsync_del"
        
        # If running interactively, then:
        if [ "$PS1" ]; then
            alias ls='ls -sF'
            alias grep='grep --color=auto'
            alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
            alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
        
        
            # enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
            # this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile
            # sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
            if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then
                . /etc/bash_completion
            fi
        
            # set a new prompt and the directory as window title
        
            # PROMPT_DIRTRIM=1 makes the dir in window title have 1 trailing dir name
            # (instead of the whole path)
            export PROMPT_DIRTRIM=1
        
            # Let prompt in terminal window (PS1) display username, time and
            # current working directory
            PS1='\u:\D{%H.%M} \W> '
            # Add directory info to the title bar: (often done in terminal prefs too)
            PS1=$PS1"\[\e]0;\w\a\]"
        fi

The handy ``rsync`` commands for copying files require a list of files
to ignore, so a file `.rsyncexclude <https://github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/tree/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/.rsyncexclude>`_ must
be present in the home holder:

.. code-block:: text

        .#*
        *.rsync~
        *.a
        *.o
        *.so

        .*~
        *.log
        *.dvi
        *.aux
        *.old
        tmp_*
        *_tmp*
        *.tmp
        tmp.*

Operating the Vagrant machine
=============================

For a user, the initialization of a new machine depends on
whether it is a complete Vagrant machine or an empty Vagrant machine.


.. admonition:: Important

   On a Windows computer,
   always operate the Vagrant machine from Cygwin's terminal, which has
   both an ssh-client and an X-server. The terminal can
   be started from Start - All Programs - Cygwin-X - XWin Server.




Operating a complete Vagrant machine
------------------------------------

The Vagrant machine ``course.box``, created
as described in the section :ref:`vagrant:complete:install`, can now be
distributed to users.
A user must do the following steps.

**Step 1.**
Install VirtualBox and Vagrant as described in
the section :ref:`vagrant:install`.

**Step 2.**
Create a directory ``vagrant`` and move ``course.box``
to this directory. We also recommend to make a subdirectory
``projects`` where all files and directories to be used from
the Vagrant machine reside. You edit files in the ``vagrant/projects``
directory tree on the host.

**Step 3.**
Run the these commands from the ``vagrant`` directory:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant box add course course.box
        Terminal> vagrant init course

**Step 4.**
Start X11 on the host: run Applications - Utilities - X11 on a Mac,
or Start - All Programs - Cygwin-X - XWin Server on Windows.

**Step 5.**
Start (boot) the Vagrant machine:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant up

**Step 5.**
Log in on the machine:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant ssh

Log out with Ctrl-D as usual in Unix terminal windows.

Operating an empty Vagrant machine
----------------------------------

The user has the files ``Vagrantfile`` and some installation script,
say ``install_minimal.sh`` as described in the section :ref:`vagrant:empty:install`.
The user should make some directory ``vagrant``, copy ``Vagrantfile``
and ``install_minimal.sh`` to this directory, and from this directory
run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant up
        Terminal> vagrant ssh

The first command takes a long time to execute since it runs the
installation script. Log out with Ctrl-D.

Working with an initialized Vagrant machine
-------------------------------------------

The daily work with the Vagrant machine is very easy. Simply go to the ``vagrant``
directory where the machine resides and run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> vagrant up
        Terminal> vagrant ssh

You are now inside the machine and can reach
files on the host from
``/vagrant/projects`` (see the next section for more details).
Log out with Ctrl-D and in again with ``vagrant ssh``.
Create and edit files on the host in ``~/vagrant/projects`` and its
subdirectories.

Before closing a laptop or shutting it down, it is recommended
to log out of the Vagrant machine and run ``vagrant suspend``.

.. _vagrant:shareddir:

Shared directories
------------------

Inside the Vagrant machine, ``/vagrant`` is a directory shared with the
user's file system. More precisely, ``/vagrant`` points to the *project
directory* where the file ``Vagrantfile`` resides and where the ``vagrant
up`` command was run (``~/vagrant`` if you have followed the specific
directory naming suggested in this document).
If users of the Vagrant machine keeps all their
files relevant for the machine in the project directory and its
subdirectories, all these directories will be shared between the machine and
the user's file system. Normally, this feature is enough for efficient
communication of files between the Vagrant machine's file system and
the user's file system.  One can also set up other shared directories, see
the Vagrant documentation for `Synced Directories <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-directories/basic_usage.html>`_.

Since the Vagrant machine shares directories with the host system, users
can safely edit files in the shared directories with their favorite editor
on the host system. The Vagrant machine will have immediate access to
the files.

Here is a typical example. Assume that ``vagrant up`` and ``vagrant ssh``
were run in a directory ``myubuntu``. On the host,
create a subdirectory ``src`` of ``myubuntu``. Start an editor and type in
the following Python program in a file ``test1.py``:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        x = np.linspace(0, 3, 11)
        y = np.exp(-x)
        plt.plot(x, y)
        plt.show()

This program will show X11 graphics on your host machine. If this machine
runs the Linux operating system, everything is fine, but if this is a Mac
or Windows machine, X11 must be started as described in
the section :ref:`vagrant:X11`. If that is necessary, log out, start X11,
log in again (``vagrant ssh``).

Run the ``test1.py`` program:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> cd /vagrant
        Terminal> cd src
        Terminal> python test1.py

A plot of the curve :math:`y = e^{-x}` should now be seen on the screen.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting: shared directory is invisible  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may happen that the ``/vagrant`` directory seems empty inside
the Vagrant machine. Two steps will fix this problem. First,
run

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup

inside the Vagrant machine. Second, log out and run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> sudo vagrant reload

outside the Vagrant machine.
Then do ``vagrant ssh`` and take an ``ls /vagrant`` to see that the
files in the project directory (e.g., ``Vagrantfile`` and the Vagrant
box) are visible.

Troubleshooting: "couldn't connect to display ..."  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error message points to the problem that X11 graphics on the
Vagrant machine cannot be shown on the host's screen.
Inserting the line ``config.ssh.forward_x11 = true``
in the file ``Vagrantfile`` in the project directory and starting X11
on the host are the two steps that will fix the problem.
Unless you build a Vagrant box, the editing of ``Vagrantfile`` should
not be required as a ready-made box was packaged with
X11 forwarding (cf. the ``vagrant package`` command
in the section :ref:`vagrant:complete:install`).
To start X11 on Mac,
run Applications - Utilities - X11, while on Windows, go to
Start - All Programs - Cygwin-X - XWin Server. Log out of the
Vagrant machine (Ctrl-D) and in again (``vagrant ssh``).

Troubleshooting: Internet is not reachable  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A test if Internet is reachable is to run a ``ping`` command inside
the machine, e.g.,

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> ping us.ubuntu.archive.com

A hanging command indicates that Internet is not reachable.
Log out of the box, run ``vagrant reload``, and
``vagrant ssh``. Try the ``ping`` command again.

Stopping the Vagrant machine
----------------------------

There are three ways to stop the virtual Vagrant machine from the
host (i.e., you must be logged out by Ctrl-D from the machine):

 * ``vagrant suspend`` sends the machine to sleep mode. Waking it up is
   done with ``vagrant up``.

 * ``vagrant halt`` shuts off the machine. To start it again, a full
   boot with ``vagrant up`` is needed.

 * The machine can be removed forever by ``vagrant destroy``.

Placing the Vagrant machine in the cloud
----------------------------------------

There are numerous free file hosting sites where a Vagrant machine can
be stored and shared with others.  We have found Google Drive to be a
viable solution. It is free, can handle large enough files, and has
flexible functionality for sharing the machine with others. A
potential problem with Google Drive, Sky Drive, or Dropbox is that
other computers connected to the account start to download the big
Vagrant machines. To prevent such actions, click on the Google Drive
icon on all machines that synchronize the account and deselect the
directory where you store the Vagrant machine(s).

Using VMWare Fusion
-------------------

Not written yet.

Documentation of Vagrant
------------------------

 * `The official Vagrant documentation <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/>`_
   targets web developers, but contains more details than the tutorial above.

 * `An article in The Linux Journal <http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/introducing-vagrant>`_ is
   technically slightly outdated, but gives much valuable additional
   information.

Appendix: Condensed instructions for students
=============================================

Say you want distribute a complete Vagrant machine with the URL

.. code-block:: text

        http://some.where.net/path/to/course.box

Here is the need-know-information for users:

.. #install "vagrant_install.do.txt"

Troubleshooting: shared directory is invisible  (2)
---------------------------------------------------

It may happen that the ``/vagrant`` directory seems empty inside
the Vagrant machine. Two steps will fix this problem. First,
run

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup

inside the Vagrant machine. Second, log out and run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> sudo vagrant reload

outside the Vagrant machine.
Then do ``vagrant ssh`` and take an ``ls /vagrant`` to see that the
files in the project directory (e.g., ``Vagrantfile`` and the Vagrant
box) are visible.

Troubleshooting: "couldn't connect to display ..."  (2)
-------------------------------------------------------

This error message points to the problem that X11 graphics cannot
be shown on the host. It should be sufficient to start X11 on
the host, see Step 4 above.

Troubleshooting: Internet is not reachable  (2)
-----------------------------------------------

A test if Internet is reachable is to run a ``ping`` command inside
the machine, e.g.,

.. code-block:: text

        Machine> ping us.ubuntu.archive.com

A hanging command indicates that Internet is not reachable.
Log out of the box, run ``vagrant reload``, and
``vagrant ssh``. Try the ``ping`` command again.
