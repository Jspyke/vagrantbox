===== Troubleshooting =====
label{vagrant:trouble}

=== Troubleshooting: shared directory is invisible ===

It may happen that the `/vagrant` directory seems empty inside
the Vagrant machine. Two steps will fix this problem. First,
run

!bc sys
Machine> sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup
!ec
inside the Vagrant machine. Second, log out and run

!bc
Terminal> sudo vagrant reload
!ec
outside the Vagrant machine.
Then do `vagrant ssh` and take an `ls /vagrant` to see that the
files in the project directory (e.g., `Vagrantfile` and the Vagrant
box) are visible.

=== Troubleshooting: "couldn't connect to display ..." ===

This error message points to the problem that X11 graphics on the
Vagrant machine cannot be shown on the host's screen.
Inserting the line `config.ssh.forward_x11 = true`
in the file `Vagrantfile` in the project directory and starting X11
on the host are the two steps that will fix the problem.
Unless you build a Vagrant box, the editing of `Vagrantfile` should
not be required as a ready-made box was packaged with
X11 forwarding (cf. the `vagrant package` command
in Section ref{vagrant:complete:install}).
To start X11 on Mac,
run Applications - Utilities - X11, while on Windows, go to
Start - All Programs - Cygwin-X - XWin Server. Log out of the
Vagrant machine (Ctrl-D) and in again (`vagrant ssh`).

# #ifdef EXTRA
This is not necessary:

Any files or directories the user may want to sync between his own
computer and the virtual machine can be specified before running
vagrant up by adding the following line to the autogenerated
Vagrantfile:

!bc sys
config.vm.share_directory "name_of_identifier", "/path/on/virtual/machine", "/path/on/host"
!ec

The first argument is an identifier, the second is the path to where
to mount the file or directory on the virtual machine, and the third is
the path on the host to the actual file or directory. By syncing a
directory, the directory becomes accessible from both the host and the
virtual machine. This way the user can edit files with his or her
favorite editor on the host machine. Once it is saved, it can be run
in the terminal window accessing the virtual machine where all
dependencies are pre-installed.
# #endif

=== Troubleshooting: Internet is not reachable ===

A test if Internet is reachable is to run a `ping` command inside
the machine, e.g.,

!bc sys
Machine> ping us.ubuntu.archive.com
!ec
A hanging command indicates that Internet is not reachable.
Log out of the box, run `vagrant reload`, and
`vagrant ssh`. Try the `ping` command again.
