__Step 1.__ Download and install "VirtualBox":
"https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads". Choose the version
according to the operating system on the host.
For example, if you want to build or run Vagrant machines under Mac OS X, choose
*VirtualBox x.y.z for OS X hosts*, where `x.y.z` is the version number
of VirtualBox. Double click the downloaded `.dmg` file to install
Vagrant. Those who work on a Windows machines will select *VirtualBox
x.y.z for Windows hosts*, which downloads an `.exe` file which can just
be double clicked to perform the installation.

__Step 2.__ Download and install "Vagrant": "http://downloads.vagrantup.com/".
Choose the latest version and the installation file corresponding to
the host's operating system (where you installed VirtualBox).  On a Mac, you
select the `Vagrant-x.y.z.dmg` file (`x.y.z` denotes the version of
the software), on Windows the `Vagrant_x.y.z.msi` file is the
relevant choice.
On Ubuntu, select `vagrant_x.y.z_*.deb` and install it
by `sudo dpkg -i vagrant_x.y.z_*.deb`.

__Step 3 for Windows users.__ If you have a Windows machine, you
should install "Cygwin": "http://cygwin.com/install.html".  Download
the Cygwin's "setup.exe": "http://cygwin.com/setup.exe" file and
follow the instructions given by the installer. Make sure you manually
select the 'X11' category during installation.  Notice that
downloading Cygwin might take one or more hours, depending on the
speed of your network.  Cygwin is not needed on Mac computers.

__Step 4.__
Start X11: run Applications - Utilities - X11 on a Mac,
or Start - All Programs - Cygwin-X - XWin Server on Windows.

__Step 5.__ Move to your home directory and make a new directory
`vagrant` and a subdirectory `projects`:

!bc sys
Terminal> cd
Terminal> mkdir vagrant
Terminal> mkdir vagrant/projects
Terminal> cd vagrant
!ec
All files that you run from the Vagrant machine are supposed
to reside in `vagrant/projects` and its subdirectories.

__Step 6.__ Download the file from URL: "${shorturl}" and store it as
`${course_name}.box` in the `vagrant` directory.  The file is *big*,
${boxsize} Gb, and may take hours to download. Make sure you have a
stable Internet connection and that you do not bring your computer to
sleep before the complete file is downloaded.


__Step 7.__ Make sure you stand in the `vagrant` directory.
Run

!bc sys
Terminal> vagrant box add ${course_name} ${course_name}.box
Terminal> vagrant init ${course_name}
Terminal> vagrant up
Terminal> vagrant ssh
!ec
You are now inside a full-blown Ubuntu system with all software you need
for the course.


__Step 8.__
Open a file `vagrant/projects/test1.py` in an editor on the host system
and write the following lines in the file:

!bc pypro
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 3, 11)
y = np.exp(-x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
!ec
Save the file. Move to the terminal window with the Ubuntu (Vagrant) machine.
Run

!bc sys
Machine> cd /vagrant/projects
Machine> python test1.py
!ec
You should see a plot of $e^{-x}$ on the screen. If you encounter
any problems, read the
