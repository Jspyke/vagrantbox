"Docker": "http://www.docker.com/" is a tool for packaging applications
with all their dependencies such that the applications can be run
on ``any'' computing platform. Docker differs from a normal virtual
machine in that "it does not include a full guest operating system": "http://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/".

A Docker Linux container must be run on a Linux host, which can be
Vagrant or a Linux Virtual Machine.

Thanks for this, it's really great! Actually Garth and I had exactly
>>  the same idea and we have begun development on a branch here:
>>
>>
>> https://bitbucket.org/garth-wells/fenics-virtual/src/8f25457e2be23b74d29dbdd97aa292d6af7df082/?at=vagrant-docker
>>
>>  We are supporting vagrant with both virtualbox and docker providers.
>>
>>  Perhaps we could join efforts at this point? I think we are perhaps
>> a
>>  little ahead on the vagrant/virtualbox approach, whilst you seem to
>>  have the manual source builds sorted. Also our docs are more
>> detailed.
>>  Together I think we could work towards a really complete approach.
>>
>>  What I think would be good:
>>
>>  We could use the docker.io 'trusted build' facilities to generate
>> the
>>  docker images from a Dockerfile hosted on a repository in bitbucket.
>>  Then the images would automatically appear on docker.io. Three
>> images
>>  might be suitable:
>>
>>  1) FEniCS stable from Ubuntu PPA.
>>  2) FEniCS nightly built using Dorsal.
>>  3) FEniCS stable built using Dorsal.
>>
>>  Then the Vagrant script will pull the correct image based on an
>>  environment variable (see my example).
>>
>>  Also I have had great success using
>>  https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker as the base image for
>>  docker. Could we standardise on this base-image? It has many
>>  advantages over the default ubunty base image in that it acts more
>>  like a 'proper' ubuntu system with init etc.
>>
>>  Long-term after sufficient testing we make vagrant the official way
>> of
>>  installing FEniCS on all non-Ubuntu platforms.
